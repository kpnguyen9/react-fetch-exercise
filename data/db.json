Everything works fine in development mode. The connection between the front-end and back-end is made through websocket.\r\n\r\nMost interesting thing is, that after doing yarn build to create the production build of the app, all the pages work fine. The only thing is that, the page that integrates connection with the back-end is returning error when I inspected it in the browser. I am using Apache Server to run the build version of the app on localhost.\r\n\r\nI am using Apache server since python server throws errors on page refresh.\r\n\r\nFrom the included screenshot, as you can see, node server command, return the expected response from the backend app. The structure of the app is also shown; revealing the relationship between the front-end (smartschool and smartresult) and back-end (smartapi). Only the smartresult makes the request to back-end. \r\n\r\nActually, the websocket url in development (connects perfectly) is:\r\nws://localhost:8881\r\nwhile the url reported as error in the console, after using yarn build to create the production build (not connecting) is:\r\nws://lo77.js.1calhost:8881/socket.io/?EI0=4&transport=websocket\r\n\r\nHow do I resolve this connection problem? Any help will be appreciated. Thank you.\r\n\r\n### Did you try recovering your dependencies?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Your module tree might be corrupted, and that might be causing the issues.\r\n  Let's try to recover it. First, delete these files and folders in your project:\r\n\r\n    * node_modules\r\n    * package-lock.json\r\n    * yarn.lock\r\n\r\n  Then you need to decide which package manager you prefer to use.\r\n  We support both npm (https://npmjs.com) and yarn (https://yarnpkg.com/).\r\n  However, **they can't be used together in one project** so you need to pick one.\r\n\r\n  If you decided to use npm, run this in your project directory:\r\n\r\n    npm install -g npm@latest\r\n    npm install\r\n\r\n  This should fix your project.\r\n\r\n  If you decided to use yarn, update it first (https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).\r\n  Then run in your project directory:\r\n\r\n    yarn\r\n\r\n  This should fix your project.\r\n\r\n  Importantly, **if you decided to use yarn, you should never run `npm install` in the project**.\r\n  For example, yarn users should run `yarn add <library>` instead of `npm install <library>`.\r\n  Otherwise your project will break again.\r\n\r\n  Have you done all these steps and still see the issue?\r\n  Please paste the output of `npm --version` and/or `yarn --version` to confirm.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNot a dependency issue, but obfuscation issue in production. Websocket link is only broken in production build.\r\n\r\n### Which terms did you search for in User Guide?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  There are a few common documented problems, such as watcher not detecting changes, or build failing.\r\n  They are described in the Troubleshooting section of the User Guide:\r\n\r\n  https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/troubleshooting\r\n\r\n  Please scan these few sections for common problems.\r\n  Additionally, you can search the User Guide itself for something you're having issues with:\r\n\r\n  https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/\r\n\r\n  If you didn't find the solution, please share which words you searched for.\r\n  This helps us improve documentation for future readers who might encounter the same problem.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nI have searched:\r\n\"websocket link broken in production build\";\r\n\"reactJs not connecting to nodeJs in production build\";\r\n\"webscoket not working in production build\"\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  To help identify if a problem is specific to a platform, browser, or module version, information about your environment is required.\r\n  This enables the maintainers quickly reproduce the issue and give feedback.\r\n\r\n  Run the following command in your React app's folder in terminal.\r\n  Note: The result is copied to your clipboard directly.\r\n\r\n  `npx create-react-app --info`\r\n\r\n  Paste the output of the command in the section below.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNot applicable\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  How would you describe your issue to someone who doesn’t know you or your project?\r\n  Try to write a sequence of steps that anybody can repeat to see the issue.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n(Write your steps here:)\r\n\r\n1. Create a reactJs project that connects to nodeJs backend using websocket\r\n2. Create the production build by running the command: yarn build\r\n3. Serve the build version on local server such as Apache, and test if the webscoket connection works\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  How did you expect the tool to behave?\r\n  It’s fine if you’re not sure your understanding is correct.\r\n  Just write down what you thought would happen.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nReactJs front-end should connect to the NodeJs back-end successfully\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Did something go wrong?\r\n  Is something broken, or not behaving as you expected?\r\n  Please attach screenshots if possible! They are extremely helpful for diagnosing issues.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n![react not connecting](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19148306/162556957-69dada77-8a2e-42fd-83ad-8e2f57c176d0.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Reproducible demo\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  If you can, please share a project that reproduces the issue.\r\n  This is the single most effective way to get an issue fixed soon.\r\n\r\n  There are two ways to do it:\r\n\r\n    * Create a new app and try to reproduce the issue in it.\r\n      This is useful if you roughly know where the problem is, or can’t share the real code.\r\n\r\n    * Or, copy your app and remove things until you’re left with the minimal reproducible demo.\r\n      This is useful for finding the root cause. You may then optionally create a new project.\r\n\r\n  This is a good guide to creating bug demos: https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve\r\n  Once you’re done, push the project to GitHub and paste the link to it below:\r\n-->\r\n\r\nI believe anyone can reproduce this issue by creating a reactJs app that connects to nodeJs server using websocket.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  What happens if you skip this step?\r\n\r\n  We will try to help you, but in many cases it is impossible because crucial\r\n  information is missing. In that case we'll tag an issue as having a low priority,\r\n  and eventually close it if there is no clear direction.\r\n\r\n  We still appreciate the report though, as eventually somebody else might\r\n  create a reproducible example for it.\r\n\r\n  Thanks for helping us help you!\r\n-->\r\n",
